Amazon SageMaker AI is a fully managed machine learning (ML) service. With SageMaker AI, data scientists and developers can quickly and confidently build, train, and deploy ML models into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides a UI experience for running ML workflows that makes SageMaker AI ML tools available across multiple integrated development environments (IDEs).

With SageMaker AI, you can store and share your data without having to build and manage your own servers. This gives you or your organizations more time to collaboratively build and develop your ML workflow, and do it sooner. SageMaker AI provides managed ML algorithms to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With built-in support for bring-your-own-algorithms and frameworks, SageMaker AI offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to your specific workflows. Within a few steps, you can deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment from the SageMaker AI console.
